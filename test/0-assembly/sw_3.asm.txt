# 1. CPU points to memory location 0xbfc00234 using $t9
# 2. CPU has 0x12345678 in $s7
# 3. CPU stores $s7 into the location pointed by $t9
# 4. CPU reads 0x12345678 from memory[0xbfc00234] back into $v0
# expected output = 0x1f2e3abc


# 1k bytes = 2^10 bytes
# 00 0000 0000 -> 0x 0 0 0

# program memory is from 0x0000 to 0x01ff
